============

OSX dotfiles for Git Bash on Windows
_('cause there are OSX guys that have to work on Win and don't want to miss some unix shell flavor there)_

This repo aims at bringing some of [Paul Irish's dotfiles](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles) to the Windows Git Bash and extends them with some win specific and useful ones as well.

## Installation

So far, simply clone this repo and the according files to your bash home (~). A proper sync mechanism will be added soon.

### Suggested shell

Please don't use the standard Windows prompt...instead install

- Git and according Git Bash
- [ConEmu](https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/)
